    '0%': { transform: 'rotate(0deg)' },
    '100%': { transform: 'rotate(180deg)' },
  },
  'barrel-roll-reverse': {
    '0%': { transform: 'rotate(180deg)' },

## Git Workflow
- Main branch: `main`
- Feature branches: `feature/feature-name`
- Commit messages: Descriptive and following conventional commits

## Dependencies
Key dependencies and their purposes:
- `framer-motion`: Animations and transitions
- `react-router-dom`: Client-side routing
- `@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio`: Image aspect ratio utilities

### Session Summary (July 24, 2024)

This session focused primarily on troubleshooting and refining existing features, improving deployment, and creating documentation.

*   **Art Gallery Modal Refinements:** Addressed issues with the two-stage modal on the Art page (`src/pages/Art.tsx`), including:
    *   Fixing image fitting (`object-contain`) in the details modal.
    *   Implementing and debugging panning functionality in the fullscreen modal (`framer-motion`, `useMotionValue`).
    *   Ensuring the reset button correctly resets pan, zoom, and rotation.
    *   Adjusting drag constraints and animation behavior for smoother interaction across browsers (Safari, Brave).
*   **Image Handling:** Corrected the path for images in the `artworks` array (`artworks/image.jpg` instead of `/artworks/image.jpg`). Created the `public/artworks` directory to correctly store artwork images.
*   **Special View Fix:** Updated the "Special View" button functionality to correctly toggle the barrel roll animation (`rotate-180`) in the Art gallery view.
*   **Deployment Troubleshooting (GitHub Pages):** Diagnosed and resolved issues causing a blank page on the custom domain (`valipokkann.in`), which were identified as related to:
    *   Incorrect `base` path in `vite.config.ts` (`./` changed to `/`).
    *   Lack of a GitHub Actions workflow for building and deploying the Vite app.
    *   Created a new GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) to automate the build (`npm run build`) and deployment to the `gh-pages` branch using `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4`.
    *   Correctly configured GitHub Pages settings to deploy from the `gh-pages` branch using "GitHub Actions" as the source.
    *   Resolved "Permission denied" errors for `github-actions[bot]` by updating Workflow Permissions in GitHub settings to "Read and write permissions".
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Updated the `README.md` with detailed instructions on local setup and deployment via GitHub Actions, including custom domain setup and troubleshooting common issues like permissions.
    *   Created a new `CONTENT_GUIDE.md` file providing instructions on managing website content (Articles, Artwork, Links, general text/images).
