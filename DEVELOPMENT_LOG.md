  'barrel-roll-reverse': 'barrel-roll-reverse 1s ease-in-out forwards',
},
keyframes: {
  'barrel-roll': {
    '0%': { transform: 'rotate(0deg)' },
    '100%': { transform: 'rotate(180deg)' },
  },
  'barrel-roll-reverse': {
    '0%': { transform: 'rotate(180deg)' },
    '100%': { transform: 'rotate(0deg)' },
  },
}
```

##### Theme System

7. Newsletter subscription
8. Artwork filtering and search
9. Multi-language support

## Known Issues
- None currently

## Development Notes
- Use `npm run dev` for local development
- Use `npm run build` for production build
- Use `npm run preview` to preview production build

## Git Workflow
- Main branch: `main`
- Feature branches: `feature/feature-name`
- Commit messages: Descriptive and following conventional commits

## Dependencies
Key dependencies and their purposes:
- `framer-motion`: Animations and transitions
- `react-router-dom`: Client-side routing

## Design Decisions
1. Chose Tailwind CSS for rapid development and consistent design
2. Implemented barrel roll animation as a unique interactive element
3. Used Framer Motion for smooth page transitions
4. Adopted TypeScript for better type safety and developer experience

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading for routes
