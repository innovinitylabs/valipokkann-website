The Untold Roots of Probabilistic Reasoning\\n\\n*By Valipokkann*\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nBayes Theorem, widely known today as a cornerstone of probability theory, is usually credited to Thomas Bayes (1701–1761), who formulated the rule that now bears his name. The theorem is mathematically expressed as:\\n\\n$$\\nP(A|B) = \\\\frac{P(B|A) \\\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\\n$$\\n\\nThis formula allows us to update our beliefs about event A when new evidence B comes in.\\n\\nBut did Bayes invent this kind of reasoning out of thin air? Was this form of conditional inference unknown to the world before the 18th century? The answer is far more nuanced — and far older — than most modern textbooks admit. The intellectual soil for Bayesian reasoning existed long before Bayes — deeply rooted in ancient Indian epistemology, particularly in Sanskrit philosophical traditions.\\n\\n## The Indian Foundations: Nyaya and Vaisheshika\\n\\nLong before Europe even dreamt of formal probability, Indian philosophers were deeply engaged with the problem of inference (*anumana*) and valid knowledge (*pramana*). The **Nyaya Sutras**, attributed to Akshapada Gautama (dated around 2nd century BCE or earlier), laid out a highly sophisticated system of logical reasoning.\\n\\nNyaya epistemology recognizes four valid means of knowledge:\\n\\n1. **Pratyaksha (Perception)**\\n2. **Anumana (Inference)**\\n3. **Upamana (Comparison)**\\n4. **Shabda (Verbal Testimony)**\\n\\nThe focus on *anumana* closely resembles probabilistic reasoning. When we observe smoke, we infer fire — but this inference depends on prior knowledge of how often smoke is caused by fire (*P(Smoke|Fire)*) and how often smoke appears without fire (*P(Smoke|¬Fire)*). While not written as an equation, this is exactly the kind of conditional thinking Bayes Theorem later formalized.\\n\\n## Dharmakirti and the Buddhist Logicians: Proto-Bayesian Thinkers\\n\\nThe Buddhist epistemologists, particularly **Dharmakirti (c. 7th century CE)**, took these ideas even further. His famous *Hetu-cakra* or \\\"Wheel of Reason\\\" classified logical reasons into various strengths based on how universally they co-occur with an effect.\\n\\nDharmakirti essentially stated:\\n\\n> *When evidence supports the presence of a cause, our confidence increases proportionally; if not, it decreases.*\\n\\nIf that doesn't sound Bayesian, what does?\\n\\nThe *Hetu-cakra* directly deals with:\\n\\n- The **strength** of evidence\\n- The **probability** of co-occurrence\\n- The **likelihood** that new evidence modifies prior belief\\n\\nIn modern language, these are exactly the ingredients of Bayesian inference: prior, likelihood, and posterior.\\n\\n## The Tradition of Mental Mathematics: Why the Formula Wasn't Written\\n\\nOne natural question arises: if these ideas existed, why wasn't Bayes Theorem written down as a formula in ancient India?\\n\\nThe answer lies in the very **intellectual culture of India**. Indian mathematical and logical traditions placed enormous emphasis on **mental computation**, a practice deeply embedded in systems like **Vedic Mathematics**. Complex calculations were routinely performed mentally, without the need for written formulas or symbolic notations.\\n\\nThe oral tradition, combined with immense memorization capabilities, allowed scholars to manipulate large numbers, intricate logical chains, and even astronomical calculations entirely in their minds. The focus was on mastering concepts and reasoning skills rather than on formal symbolic representations.\\n\\nIn this environment, the kind of conditional inference we now call Bayesian was **understood, practiced, and applied mentally** through qualitative and conceptual reasoning, not through algebraic formulas.\\n\\n## The Western Formalization\\n\\nWhen Thomas Bayes and later Pierre-Simon Laplace developed the algebraic form of conditional probability, they were stepping into a line of thought that existed for centuries elsewhere — but now wearing the garb of European mathematics.\\n\\nMuch like how Newton's calculus came centuries after Kerala mathematicians like Madhava had laid out infinite series expansions, the mathematical formalization of inference simply arrived later in Europe.\\n\\n## The Colonial Disregard\\n\\nOne must also acknowledge the deliberate dismissal of non-European intellectual contributions during colonialism. Colonial scholarship often presented European thinkers as the first discoverers of universal truths while ignoring or downplaying sophisticated systems in Indian, Chinese, Arab, and African traditions.\\n\\nIronically, the very kind of inferential logic Bayes formalized was already a living, breathing intellectual current in Sanskrit philosophical discourse — but received little recognition in the Eurocentric historical narrative.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nTo ask \\\"Did Bayes Theorem come from Sanskrit literature?\\\" is to ask the wrong question. The better question is:\\n\\n**\\\"Was the *thinking* behind Bayes Theorem present in ancient Indian texts?\\\"**\\n\\nThe answer is a resounding **yes**.\\n\\nIndian philosophers in Sanskrit traditions laid the conceptual bedrock for reasoning under uncertainty, long before the West turned it into an algebraic formula. The global story of knowledge is far older, far richer, and far more interconnected than colonial textbooks have allowed us to believe.\\n\\n---\\n\\n*\\\"The lamp of wisdom was never lit in one place alone.\\\"*\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Further Reading\\n\\n- Nyaya Sutras of Akshapada Gautama\\n- Dharmakirti's *Pramana-varttika*\\n- Bimal Krishna Matilal's *The Navya-Nyaya Doctrine of Negation*\\n- Subhash Kak's works on Indian epistemology and probability\\n- Bharati Krishna Tirthaji's *Vedic Mathematics* \""],"names":["bayesSanskrit"],"mappings":"AAAA,MAAeA,EAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;"}
